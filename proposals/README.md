# Proposals

Proposals are the way to propose changes to the project. They are the way to propose new features, changes to existing features, and changes to the project itself.

## Proposal Process

1. Create a new branch in your fork
2. Create a new `.md` file in the `proposals` directory
3. Write your proposal, every proposal should includes POC (Proof of Concept) code. This [example](https://github.com/GuanceCloud/ppl/pull/18) is a good start.
4. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the main repository
5. The proposal will be discussed and, if accepted, merged into the `main` branch
