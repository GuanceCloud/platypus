Guance Cloud PPL (Pipeline Processor Language) is a domain-specific language for data processing, mainly for text and semi-structured data processing. PPL can be used for large-scale log parsing and feature extraction at the edge. Multiple extraction methods such as Grok, JSON and XML are supported.
As a data processing language, PPL greatly improves the programmability of text and semi-structured processing.
